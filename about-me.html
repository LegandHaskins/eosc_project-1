  <p class="hotrad" >When I got to the program I got to learn a whole bunch about coding and entrepreneurship and leadership. When I first  got into the program I didn't know a lot about coding. But after watching a lot of videos and asking for help it became a lot easier  to comprehend how everything worked and went together. Even though i understand most of it I still know i need a lot more practice. So I plan to work very hard to perfect my skills. And i plan to make a bunch more websites and each one will look better that the last. This was the first computer engineering,entrepanurship, and leadership program  I have been in, and being surrounded by people of color, that I could relate I thought it was awsome. And throughout the rest of the program I know I will have fun and learn a whole lot.

  <p>When I think of myself, I think of somebody who can be really funny when he isn't and when he is trying to. I think of a person who loves and cares for his family and for his friends. When I describe myself I think of a person who will fight for my family and for my friends, I try my best to show that I care about however there feeling even if somethimes it really dosen't matter. And i try to respect the wishes of those who's having the problems, but at times it just feels like my duty to try and help that person even if they don'twant me to.</p>
